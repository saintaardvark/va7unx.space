A while back I became interested in mapping and web development, and
decided to look around for a dataset that I could play with.  I found
one in [the New Westminster tree dataset][0].  The map is not great,
but it was fun to put together and has been moderately useful a
handful of times when trying to identify a tree on a walk.

The map can be found here: [https://va7unx.space/projects/trees][1].

The code (such as it is) is available [here][2].
