Hardware hacking:

- Play with EdgeImpulse, an esp32 and an mpu6050; collect gesture
  data.

- Got idea to use the mpu6050 for a seismometer; tried logging with
  MicroPython, and managed to get surprisingly interesting data.

- Began working on [an Arduino-powered weather vane project][0]; fired
  up 3D printer for first time in a while.

- Played with ThunderSense and got Bluetooth packets captured with Python.
