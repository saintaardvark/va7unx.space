What happened in May?  Let's see.

# Polaris

- Initial analyses for OPS-SAT, BOBCAT-1, and QUBIK
- PRs to resolve a few small issues
- Help review abstracts for conference presentations
- Lead preparation of [a proposal to run code on OPS-SAT][0].  I'm
  super excited about this.
- Played a bit with the [nanosat-mo-framework][4] in preparation for
  that proposal.
- We've got a Google Summer of Code student, Ayush Bansal! ðŸŽ‰  Very
  much looking forward to working with him.

# Space

- I've been asked to be an advisor for [ALEASAT][3], a cubesat project
  being built by UBC and SFU students.  I'm incredibly thrilled about
  this.

# Data science

- Improved the [New West tree map][1] a lot, thanks to inspiration
  taken from [opssat-smartcam-map][2]
  
# Hardware hacking

- Replaced rain sensor on weather station at my in-laws

- Tested running 3 Dallas 1-wire sensors over a 25 foot / 7.5 metre
  ethernet cable: one twisted pair element each for positive, ground
  and signal.  Worked a treat!  These are going to be buried in the
  garden there to get soil temperatures at different depths

# Radio

- First POTA activation: Ve-3300, Cariboo Hill Park.  21 contacts,
  including 2 park-to-park.  Closest I've come yet to a pileup.

- Power went out at my house for a few hours, so I used the time to
  make contacts on my homebrew magloop on 20m while it was dead quiet.
  Made England, plus one with KD6JUI/MM, who was kayaking (!) with a
  homebrew magloop (!!).

- CQ WPX contest: 55 contacts over 3 days.  I'll be honest, it was a
  bit of a chore by the end.  But I managed to make New Zealand on 5W,
  and Australia on 5W on 40m (!).
