## Home sysadmin

- Migrated mail server to EasyDNS.ca.  Quite happy with their service
  so far.

- Set up new home server on a NUC when the old, silent PC started
  having recurring hardware problems.
  
- Set up monit to monitor more stuff at home.

- New laptop: off-least T490s from Amazon.  Great price for
  16GB/512GB; just wish I liked the keyboard more.
  
## Hardware & software hacking

- Got a random LCD display working with an ESP32...surprisingly hard.

- More playing with the seismometer.  [Daily reports now being
  generated][0].
  
- Got [tree-sitter working in Emacs][1].  This is wonderful. 

- Got nodered, MQTT set up; three ESP32 thermometers set up (see
  Climate Emergency section ahead).
  
- Repair work on tipping bucket rain meter at weather station.

- Start work on [tree tomography project][4].

- Start graphing data for air quality in Sault Ste Marie, where my
  parents live.  It's not great. ☹️

## Climate emergency

- Continuing to send letters to provincial and federal government
  asking for faster action.
    
- Continuing to pester my MLA for meetings.

- Got a portable AC just in time for the heat wave this summer.
  Internal temps in our home office went over 30.5 C, but our 3rd
  floor (where the kids sleep) stayed reasonably comfortable:
