I've been interested in machine learning for a while now.  Like a lot
of things, my approach has been a bit scattered.  I'm slowly learning
how to get better at that, but I still tend to veer around.

A couple of months ago, I decided to take the [Fast.ai course][0]
again.  I had done a couple of lessons a year ago, but had not
followed it up.  This time around, I saw that they not only had a new
version of the course, but [a book][1] as well.  I ordered the book
(and [another book][3] as well), and got started on [the Jupyter
notebooks][2] that the book is based on.

Let's see where this goes!
