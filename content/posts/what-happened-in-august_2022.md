Hardware hacking:

- I ordered a bunch of [AI-Thinker ESP32 camera modules][1] from
  Universal Solder (Canadian vendor of Arduino, ESP32, electronic
  components, etc; I'm a happy customer & recommend them thoroughly).
  Started playing around with them.

- Some work on the electronic windvane.

- Add a photocell to the office weather station so I could begin to
  track light levels.
  
Climate emergency:

- Another meeting with [my MLA and the Minister of Education for
  British Columbia, Jennifer Whiteside][4].  I'm grateful to the
  Minister and her staff for the chance to talk.
  
Data science/mapping:

- Built [a map of our trip in July][2].  This was built from GPS data
  recorded along the trip; I analyzed it to find places where we
  stopped, compared those places with the charger database maintained
  by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory
  ([https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/][3]),
  and marked the places that matched chargers.  Not the most
  compelling visualization, but it's a start.

Other:

- I resigned as a Core Contributor of the Libre Space Foundation and
  the Polaris project.  It's been wonderful to work with these folks,
  and I wish everyone the best, but it's time for me to move on.
