I turned 50 in February.  Two months later, I'm still confused by
this.  Was still recovering from COVID.

# Hardware hacking

- Started work on a birdhouse camera with my father-in-law.  He built
  the birdhouse in December; this month we finally started working on
  putting together the camera part.  There are two in here: an
  infrared camera and an endoscope for visual light.  I put together a
  little circuit board with 6 500mW IR LEDs to act as illumination.

# Home sysadmin

- My little home machine is a [Zotac ZBOX CI320 nano ][0] purchased
  in 2015.  It's great -- small, unobtrusive, passively cooled and
  enough for everything I need...except that the 4GB of memory it has,
  which felt so decadent, is starting to be a constraint.  I blame
  InfluxDB.  Anyhow, ordered some more RAM only to realize I'd ordered
  the wrong size.  Made up for it by adding a swap file.  Ask your
  parents, kids.

# Climate emergency

- Met with my MLA, Judy Darcy, again about climate change; she got us
  some time with MLA George Heyman, BC's Minister of the Environment
  as well.  I'm grateful to both for their time.
