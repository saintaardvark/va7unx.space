Welp...this took a long time to write up.  In my defense, I got COVID
in January and that sort of threw me off for a couple months.  But
it's also just taken me a while to get back to it.  Anyhow, onward!

# Machine learning/data science

- I submitted my entry to the [Data Driven Cloud Cover
  Competition][0]! Aaaaand...my score was terrible.  However, I got a
  lot of practice out of this, and it was valuable for that.  I
  intended to go back and figure out exactly why my scores were so
  abysmal, but got derailed (see first paragraph).  But I think that
  for whatever reason, my GAN was just *not* working at all.  I need
  to get more practice with this technique.

- Some volunteer work for a local environmental society to demonstrate
  how to use Pandas for graphing.

# Climate emergency

- More letters to politicians.  Did not make every week, but I'm
  cutting myself some slack here.
