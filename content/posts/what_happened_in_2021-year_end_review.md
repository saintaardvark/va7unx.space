What happened in 2021?  Time to look back.

- We got an EV!  It's a Kia Soul, and I love it.

- Started writing in here semi-regularly. ðŸ’ª

- Expanded the weather station: precipitation meter, anemometer, soil
  temp, particulate matter sensors.

- [Recorded a talk for PyCascades][0]!

- Much work on machine learning and data science: the dishwasher
  loading critic, some Kaggle courses, mapping New Westminster trees.

- A lot of work on [Polaris][1]: telemetry analyses, supervising our
  third co-op student, and a proposal to run code on an ESA satellite
  (sadly, denied).

- Radio took a bit of a backseat by the end of the year.

- I was asked to be an advisor for [ALEASAT][2], and that was
  wonderful.

- [The heat wave scared me][3], and I turned that into a focus on
  climate activism.  Small steps, but I'm taking them.  Met with my
  MLA in November to discuss climate change.  I think of this as being
  the start of about 30 years of work.

- Total distance walked since getting my latest phone in January 2018:
  8,664 km.  Daily average distance in 2021 was 7.2 km, up from last
  year (6.4 km).

- Got more into birdwatching, phenology and natural history.  Lots of
  data taking, which I enjoy.

- Bird feeder camera with ML to recognize the birds.  Does a fairly
  crappy job of picking out species but a good job of detecting birds.

- Entered a couple of ML contests -- no wins, but that's expected;
  it's the practice I'm after.

- At work: joined a new team which has a definite data science focus.
  Learning a lot.

I'm leaving out all the incredibly important time with my family; this
isn't the venue I choose to record that in.
