A little late (hah!), but still trying to keep the habit.

# Polaris

- A *lot* of work getting ready for Google Summer of Code -- our third
  year participating.

- Initial analyses for a couple different satellites: QUBIK-1 and -2
  (using data from integration testing), OPSSAT (see below for why).

- Documentation improvements, always important.

- Begin working (with a crapton of other people!) on [a proposal to
  run our software on OPSSAT][1].  This has been a lot of fun.

# Machine learning / data science

- More work on the dishwasher loading critic; not as much as I would
  have liked, though.  But I did pay my son to annotate ~ 100 images. ðŸ¤˜

- Got my tree map page [put up on this website][0].

# Sysadmin

- Replace failing hard drive for Zombie, the home server that does it
  all.

# Hardware hacking

- More work on the anemometer.  My father-in-law built a shelter for
  this to keep the rain off, and we've now got the sensors/magnets
  permanently (*with crazy glue) mounted on the arms.

# Radio

- First attempt at POTA, at a local park.  Unfortunately, I only got
  four QSOs, so no good.  I think part of that is probably due to the
  location: it was in a lower part of the park, and it seemed to
  affect propagation.
