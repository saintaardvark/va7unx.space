## Hardware hacking

- More progress on the weathervane.  Designed a sort of skirt for the
  whole assembly in FreeCAD, thanks to the [FreeCAD for Makers][0]
  book by Jo Hinchcliffe, aka [Concretedog][1] (who I met at the 2017
  [Opensource Cubesat Workshop][2]).  Printed out a rough version
  which seems like it should work; next up is a nicer version, which
  looks like it should take 36 hours (!).

- Tried repairing a coffeemaker that had a blown thermal fuse.
  Replaced the fuse and tested it out...whereupon it promptly blew
  again. ðŸ˜‘

- Opened up the chickadee birdhouse at my in-laws' for the season.
  We've had some interest, which surprised me -- I thought they
  wouldn't be checking out nesting spots in January.

## Web stuff

- More work on [habit][3].

## Climate emergency

- More letters to the federal and provincial governments.  Took a
  while to get back into this after the holidays.

## Space

- Actually started at [Wyvern][4]!  OMG so much to learn.  There is a
  chance I may get to hold hardware that goes to space, which is a
  bucket list item for me.
