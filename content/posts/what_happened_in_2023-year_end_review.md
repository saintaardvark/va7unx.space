What happened in 2023?

- I got less regular about writing here semi-regularly. ðŸ˜‘

- A bunch of work on climate change -- 82 paper letters, 12 emails, 2
  protests, phone calls, in-person meetings with local politicians,
  and submissions against LNG expansion in BC.  I didn't meet my
  target of 110 letters; however, I'm starting to have second thoughts
  about those kinds of targets for personal goals.

- Two new hardware hacking projects:  tree tomography and the
  one-pixel camera.  Finished up the weather vane; no nesting from the
  chickadees this year.  Seismometer set up.  Lots of small random things.
  
- A year of working at Wyvern!  I think the infrastructure codebase is
  in good shape.
  
- Health was a mix: nothing terribly serious, but COVID plus two sinus
  infections.  Bleah.
  
- Walking: 6.8 km/day average for the year.  Down from 7.0 last year.
  Obviously this is the end times.

- Gave up on hosting my own email and delegated it to [EasyDNS.ca][0].
  Recommended.
  
- Started learning Italian.  Ãˆ molto divertentimento!

- Nature: 475 checklists for eBird (vs target of 450); 1671
  observations for iNaturalist (vs target of 1300) and 3730
  identifications (vs target of 900).  
  
- [Added a few Wikipedia pages][2] and [updated more][3], mainly for
  species I'd observed for iNaturalist.
  
- I read 53 books.  Of these, ["The Good War" by Studs Terkel][1] was
  the most mind-blowing; it's an utterly compelling oral history,
  mainly from the American point of view, of people's involvement in
  World War II.  I had never thought that moral ambiguity about a war,
  or deep suspicion about the US government's action in a war, was
  anything but a recent development.  Highly recommended.
