That was October.  Of 2021.  Time is weird, yo.

# Climate Emergency

- More letters each week, but now with a reply from the BC environment
  minister now that the update to BC's climate plan has come out.
  Lots of reading through that and figuring out how I feel about it.

- More asking my MLA (who's the education minister) for a meeting to
  talk about fracking.  No response.

- Attended a protest for the first time since university.  Felt
  awkward...but if that's the worst, I'll keep doing this.

# Hardware hacking

- Playing with a TM1638 module I ordered.

- BIRBCAM!  Set up cheap binoculars so that they're focused on a bird
  feeder at my in-laws' house; set up a webcam behind them; get the
  Coral dev board connected to their wifi; get Motion running on it;
  and get Motion taking pictures, then getting an example script to
  analyze the pictures post-hoc.  The identification is a little all
  over the map, but as a bird _detector_ it works great.  Pic can be
  found [here][1].

- I ordered a handheld anemometer a while back; it arrived, and I
  realized it did Bluetooth.  That led me down the path of trying to
  decode the packets, rather than install the dodgy-looking app that
  I'm sure is totally fine, not even a problem  Still not figured out

# Data science/ML/GIS

- Finish [the Kaggle Geospatial Analysis course][0].

- Tried to do initial notebook for [AI4EO][2] challenge, and OMG the
  yak-shaving.  Gave up after a solid afternoon of just trying to get
  the thing to work.
