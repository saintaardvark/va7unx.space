What happened in 2022?

* Continued writing here semi-regularly. ðŸ’ª

* I entered the [Data Driven Cloud Cover Competition][0].  My score
  was terrible, but I learned a ton.

* Much writing to politicians about climate change -- by my count, 96
  paper letters, plus emails, phones, faxes and petitions.  Target for
  this year: 110.

* Met with my MLA, [the Honourable Jennifer Whiteside][1], about
  climate change twice; I thank her and her staff for their time.  I
  definitely want to continue this.

* Drove to Ontario with my family in our EV: 6 days driving there, 2
  weeks to visit my parents, then about 7 days back.  It all went
  quite well.

* A fair amount of hardware hacking:  a birdhouse camera, fixing the
  tipping bucket rain-o-meter in our weather station, getting
  sorta-maybe-reliable CO2 readings with an MQ135 sensor, and finally
  getting into ESP32s...man, those are fun; MicroPython is right up my
  alley.

* A lot of natural history: participated in a bioblitz; submitted 432
  eBird checklists; made 1271 observations, and 876 identifications,
  for iNaturalist.  Goals for next year:

  - eBird: 450 checklists
  - iNaturalist: 1300 observations, 900 identifications.  That's not a
    whole lot more than last year, but I did a *lot* of observing
    during the trip to Ontario.

* Continued work on my Emacs dotfiles, which has been going
  since 2009.  Wow.

* Began teaching myself web development.

* Resigned as a core contributor for the Libre Space Foundation and
  Polaris, but got a job at [Wyvern Space][2].
