February and March got away from me...but fair enough, because I
started my new job at a ðŸŒ SPACEðŸŒ COMPANY ðŸ›°ðŸ“¡ðŸ¤¯.  I'm pretty excited.
Also, though, I got COVID and then a sinus infection in March, which
sapped my energy.  I got over it, but man, that was not pleasant.

So what did I do?

## Hardware hacking

- Continued to work on firmware for weather vane.

## Climate letters

- Three sets, rather than the 8 that should have been.  But COVID.

## Work

- So much Terraform work.  I've got the luxury of setting up the
  codebase from scratch, and so far (ðŸ¤ž) I think I'm doing a decent
  job of it.

- Travelled to Edmonton for an offsite, and actually met my team in
  person for the first time.  I talked to almost everyone in the
  company.  Such an amazing bunch of people.  And hey, our first
  satellite is due to launch real soon now...
