I've found *much* better ways of examining earthquake data
received by my station.  Thanks to Alan Sheehan, who was [kind enough
to post his excellent report generation tool][1], I've now got some
actual data we can use.  I've updated his code a bit and changed it to
better match my workflow; my repo is [here][2]. Like Alan's, my code
is under the MIT License.  Share and enjoy!

Here's a sample of what we've been able to see:

This is [the result of a magnitude 6.2 earthquake][4] that struck off
the coast of El Salvador.  Fortunately, [no damage, injuries or
fatalities][5] were reported.

Here's a sample of what I'm pretty sure is a freight train going by:

This happened about 15 minutes after I saw the train go by another
crossing about 10km west of where the seismometer lives.  The
equidistant lines in the spectrum [sure seem like the ones reported in
this study][7], "Equidistant Spectral Lines in Train Vibrations" by
Florian Fuchs, GÃ¶tz Bokelmann, and the AlpArray Working Group
(https://doi.org/10.1785/0220170092 ...but see the previous link for
the actual paper).
