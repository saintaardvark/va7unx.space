Last year, my father-in-law got a trail cam at my suggestion -- mainly
to get pictures of the rats that were eating his compost.  It worked:

I borrowed it a while back, and finally set it up today under our bird
feeder to see what we could get.  Not a bad haul!  We got:

- Spotted towhees:

- Dark-eyed juncos:

- Black and grey squirrels:

- A chickadee:

Not bad!

Out for radio as well: 12 QSOs from the North American QSO contest,
including D4Z from Cape Verde -- about 9150km on 10W.  Nice!
