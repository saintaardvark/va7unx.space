Web development:

- I've become interested in web development recently, and have begun
working on a habit-tracking project called, unoriginally, [Habit][0].
Currently it's a good exercise for becoming familiar with Javascript,
Jquery, Bootstrap, Flask and SQLAlchemy.

Hardware hacking:

- I ordered a bunch of [AI-Thinker ESP32 camera modules][1] from
  Universal Solder (Canadian vendor of Arduino, ESP32, electronic
  components, etc; I'm a happy customer & recommend them thoroughly).
  Started digging into how to make it into a timelapse camera.

Random:

- I signed up for a free account with [The SDF Public Access UNIX
  System][3].  I've got a totes-real homepage at
  [http://saintaardvark.unixcab.org][4], just like the old days.
