Here's a quick list, for my own reference, of what I got up to in
January.  It's heartening to see everything laid out, and realize that
I've actually managed to get a fair bit done!

# Hardware hacking

* My father-in-law and I worked on getting the precipitation meter
  going for our weather station.  It took a while, but we finally
  got it working. ðŸŽ‰

* Some one-wire temperature sensors came in, and I was able to whip up
  a quick demo to make sure they worked.

* Talked to my father-in-law about building a [Lehmann
  seismograph][6].  Early days, but I think he's in.

# Polaris

* Worked on my [upcoming talk on Polaris for PyCascades 2021][1].
  (Final version recorded just yesterday.)

* Got a hugo site whipped together for [polarisml.space][2], which now
  has links to our demo, code, chat and documentation.

* Cut my first release for Polaris after getting [our page on PyPi][3]
  sorted out.

# Machine learning

* Some progress, though slow, on going through the [FastAI book][0].

* Tripped over [Roboflow][4], which generates synthetic data for ML;
  very interesting, and I may give this a try for the [dishwasher
  loading critic][5].

* Some initial experiments with [detecto][7], a simple wrapper for
  PyTorch object detection.

# Radio

* Not a whole lot of trips out, but some...and managing to reach [D4Z][8] Cape
  Verde on 10W.  9,155 km!

* Totalled up my contacts toward SKCC Centurion...42/100.  Normally
  I'm not big on this sort of thing, but it's a number to reach for,
  and that's no bad thing right now.
