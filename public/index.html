      <p>Here&rsquo;s what I got up to in February 2021:</p>
<h1 id="polaris">Polaris</h1>
<ul>
<li>Recorded and presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jNMDqTqD2s&amp;feature=youtu.be">my talk on Polaris for PyCascades</a>.  It
went pretty well, I think.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="machine-learningdata-science">Machine learning/data science</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Began Chapter 9 of <a href="https://book.fast.ai/">the FastAI book</a>.  This is on tabular
learning, which is really interesting; I <em>think</em> this is the sort of
approach I&rsquo;d want to take for <a href="https://gitlab.com/saintaardvark/loostmap">loostmap</a>, my attempt to predict
HF propagation by looking at data from the <a href="http://reversebeacon.net/">Reverse Beacon Network</a>
(I picked that project name from a random name generator&hellip;I really
need something that makes more sense.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Began playing with the New Westminster <a href="http://opendata.newwestcity.ca/datasets/tree-inventory-east">tree inventory</a>, an open
data file from my city.  I&rsquo;ve tried mapping that
<a href="here">https://va7unx.space/trees</a>, and the code can be found
<a href="https://gitlab.com/saintaardvark/new-west-trees">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Played with <a href="https://roboflow.com">Roboflow</a>, an online service that augments image
data for machine learning.  Also came across <a href="https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/">imgaug</a>, a Python
library that covers much the same ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some work on the <a href="https://gitlab.com/saintaardvark/dishwasher_loading_critic">dishwasher loading critic</a>, including
beginning to work with PyTorch directly rather than using
<a href="https://github.com/alankbi/detecto">Detecto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dig into what may (or may not) be <a href="https://github.com/alankbi/detecto/issues/75">a bug in Detecto with bounding
boxes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Began <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering">feature engineering course</a> on Kaggle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talked to my manager about the possibility of looking for DS/ML
projects at work.  Apparently there&rsquo;s one team he knows of that&rsquo;s
looking into a project in this area, and the possibility exists to
work with them for a bit. ðŸ¤ž</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="hardware-hacking">Hardware hacking</h1>
<ul>
<li>My father-in-law finished a prototype of our anemometer; he&rsquo;s a
retired millwright, so he actually knows what he&rsquo;s doing.  (<em>puts
popsicle sticks and yarn away</em>)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="radio">Radio</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A few contests entered.  Closer to getting my WAS &ndash; only missing
Maine and Nebraska, and state contests for those are coming up in
the next few months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reached Japan (7550 km) via CW on one watt!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sysadmin work for <a href="https://ve7scc.org">the club</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="home-sysadmin">Home sysadmin</h1>
<ul>
<li>Finally figured out <a href="https://va7unx.space/posts/fixing_apache_and_utf8/">an Apache and UTF-8 thing</a> that had been
bugging me for years</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="birding">Birding</h1>
<ul>
<li>Backyard bird count, plus started doing counts in local parks on
weekend; submitted through Audobon app, which goes to
<a href="https://ebird.org">ebird.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="gardening">Gardening</h1>
<ul>
<li>Began growing wildflower seedlings at home under a grow lamp and
promptly got mildew.  There are a couple that have survived; I plan
on transplanting those &amp; trying again.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>A while back, I started having problems with the output of Venus, a
planet-like aggregator I use to read a bunch of things. The symptoms
were broken characters for things like apostrophes, quotes and so on
&ndash; which rendered the output nearly unusable.  I dug into it,
but couldn&rsquo;t resolve the problem&hellip;so I resorted to a bletcherous hack
(cron job to copy the file to my laptop, and view it with
<code>file:///...</code>) and blamed Python 2.</p>
<p>Today I came across the same problem but manifested in another set of
files.  This time I managed to find the answer:</p>
<pre><code>AddCharset UTF-8           .htm .html .js .css
</code></pre><p>To be clear, I <em>already</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>had made sure that the headers for the file included <code>Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8</code></li>
<li>had made sure the html file had <code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf=8&quot;&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Weirdly enough, changing that <code>meta</code> tag to:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot; &gt;
</code></pre><p>worked&hellip;the apostrophes and such were displayed correctly.  But they
never showed up in the output when I ran a curl on the URL.  Does
Apache filter this stuff on the fly?</p>
<p>Anyhow&hellip;that&rsquo;s enough encoding debugging for one day.  Or possibly a year.</p>

      <p>Here&rsquo;s a quick list, for my own reference, of what I got up to in
January.  It&rsquo;s heartening to see everything laid out, and realize that
I&rsquo;ve actually managed to get a fair bit done!</p>
<h1 id="hardware-hacking">Hardware hacking</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My father-in-law and I worked on getting the precipitation meter
going for our weather station.  It took a while, but we finally
got it working. ðŸŽ‰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some one-wire temperature sensors came in, and I was able to whip up
a quick demo to make sure they worked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talked to my father-in-law about building a <a href="https://amateurgeophysics.wordpress.com/seismology/lehman-seismograph/">Lehmann
seismograph</a>.  Early days, but I think he&rsquo;s in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="polaris">Polaris</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Worked on my <a href="https://2021.pycascades.com/program/talks/polaris-open-source-machine-learning-for-spacecraft-operations/">upcoming talk on Polaris for PyCascades 2021</a>.
(Final version recorded just yesterday.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got a hugo site whipped together for <a href="https://polarisml.space">polarisml.space</a>, which now
has links to our demo, code, chat and documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut my first release for Polaris after getting <a href="https://pypi.org/project/polaris-ml/">our page on PyPi</a>
sorted out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="machine-learning">Machine learning</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some progress, though slow, on going through the <a href="https://book.fast.ai/">FastAI book</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tripped over <a href="https://roboflow.com">Roboflow</a>, which generates synthetic data for ML;
very interesting, and I may give this a try for the <a href="https://gitlab.com/saintaardvark/dishwasher_loading_critic">dishwasher
loading critic</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some initial experiments with <a href="https://github.com/alankbi/detecto">detecto</a>, a simple wrapper for
PyTorch object detection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="radio">Radio</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not a whole lot of trips out, but some&hellip;and managing to reach <a href="http://d4c.cc/">D4Z</a> Cape
Verde on 10W.  9,155 km!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Totalled up my contacts toward SKCC Centurion&hellip;42/100.  Normally
I&rsquo;m not big on this sort of thing, but it&rsquo;s a number to reach for,
and that&rsquo;s no bad thing right now.</p>

      <p>Last year, my father-in-law got a trail cam at my suggestion &ndash; mainly
to get pictures of the rats that were eating his compost.  It worked:</p>
<p><img src="/rat_trailcam.jpg" alt="Rat trail cam picture"></p>
<p>I borrowed it a while back, and finally set it up today under our bird
feeder to see what we could get.  Not a bad haul!  We got:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spotted towhees:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/trailcam-junco_and_twohee.jpg" alt="Junco and spotted towhee"></p>
<ul>
<li>Dark-eyed juncos:</li>

<li>Black and grey squirrels:</li>

<ul>
<li>A chickadee:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/trailcam-chickadee.jpg" alt="Chickadee"></p>
<p>Not bad!</p>
<p>Out for radio as well: 12 QSOs from the North American QSO contest,
including D4Z from Cape Verde &ndash; about 9150km on 10W.  Nice!</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in machine learning for a while now.  Like a lot
of things, my approach has been a bit scattered.  I&rsquo;m slowly learning
how to get better at that, but I still tend to veer around.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, I decided to take the <a href="https://course.fast.ai">Fast.ai course</a>
again.  I had done a couple of lessons a year ago, but had not
followed it up.  This time around, I saw that they not only had a new
version of the course, but <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/">a book</a> as well.  I ordered the book
(and <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-94463-0">another book</a> as well), and got started on <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastbook">the Jupyter
notebooks</a> that the book is based on.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see where this goes!</p>
