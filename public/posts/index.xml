      <description>Last year, my father-in-law got a trail cam at my suggestion &amp;ndash; mainly to get pictures of the rats that were eating his compost. It worked:
I borrowed it a while back, and finally set it up today under our bird feeder to see what we could get. Not a bad haul! We got:
 Spotted towhees:   Dark-eyed juncos:   Black and grey squirrels:   A chickadee:  Not bad!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in machine learning for a while now. Like a lot of things, my approach has been a bit scattered. I&amp;rsquo;m slowly learning how to get better at that, but I still tend to veer around.
A couple of months ago, I decided to take the Fast.ai course again. I had done a couple of lessons a year ago, but had not followed it up. This time around, I saw that they not only had a new version of the course, but a book as well.</description>
