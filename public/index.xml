      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in machine learning for a while now. Like a lot of things, my approach has been a bit scattered. I&amp;rsquo;m slowly learning how to get better at that, but I still tend to veer around.
A couple of months ago, I decided to take the Fast.ai course again. I had done a couple of lessons a year ago, but had not followed it up. This time around, I saw that they not only had a new version of the course, but a book as well.</description>
