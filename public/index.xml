      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s what I got up to in February 2021:
Polaris  Recorded and presented my talk on Polaris for PyCascades. It went pretty well, I think.  Machine learning/data science   Began Chapter 9 of the FastAI book. This is on tabular learning, which is really interesting; I think this is the sort of approach I&amp;rsquo;d want to take for loostmap, my attempt to predict HF propagation by looking at data from the Reverse Beacon Network (I picked that project name from a random name generator&amp;hellip;I really need something that makes more sense.</description>

      <description>A while back, I started having problems with the output of Venus, a planet-like aggregator I use to read a bunch of things. The symptoms were broken characters for things like apostrophes, quotes and so on &amp;ndash; which rendered the output nearly unusable. I dug into it, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t resolve the problem&amp;hellip;so I resorted to a bletcherous hack (cron job to copy the file to my laptop, and view it with file:///.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick list, for my own reference, of what I got up to in January. It&amp;rsquo;s heartening to see everything laid out, and realize that I&amp;rsquo;ve actually managed to get a fair bit done!
Hardware hacking   My father-in-law and I worked on getting the precipitation meter going for our weather station. It took a while, but we finally got it working. ðŸŽ‰
  Some one-wire temperature sensors came in, and I was able to whip up a quick demo to make sure they worked.</description>

      <description>Last year, my father-in-law got a trail cam at my suggestion &amp;ndash; mainly to get pictures of the rats that were eating his compost. It worked:
I borrowed it a while back, and finally set it up today under our bird feeder to see what we could get. Not a bad haul! We got:
 Spotted towhees:   Dark-eyed juncos:   Black and grey squirrels:   A chickadee:  Not bad!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in machine learning for a while now. Like a lot of things, my approach has been a bit scattered. I&amp;rsquo;m slowly learning how to get better at that, but I still tend to veer around.
A couple of months ago, I decided to take the Fast.ai course again. I had done a couple of lessons a year ago, but had not followed it up. This time around, I saw that they not only had a new version of the course, but a book as well.</description>
